the idea of this project is to help people reach their optimum health with the help of this website where the individual can track his/her workrate and intake from day to day.
I am a heavy MMA and Football person and to be consistent in those fields, you need a reliable diet that could last long and help maintain or even surpass the perfect health. this diet planner not only monitors my health, but supplies the best and most delicious healthy food!
we got- diet tracking, meal suggestions, survey for an individual incase they are either bulking , cutting or to maintain and best of all a personal mentor.
to have an online platform where people with the similar goals come together (opyional for the viewer),as time goes on include AI.
i use a bright blue theme to represent the earth tones to give the viewer not just an open mind but a health aura in the website.
used microsoft pain for the logo, used AI for the review pictures
